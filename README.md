## FuzzyLogicToolbox
A fuzzy logic system is a mathematical framework used for decision making and control in systems where the input information is imprecise or uncertain. The fuzzy logic toolbox allows the user to define the system's variables, sets, rules, and crisp values, and then performs the necessary calculations to generate a predicted output based on the defined rules. The toolbox can be used to model and analyze a wide range of applications, including control systems, pattern recognition, and decision making.

## Features
- Define a new fuzzy logic system.
- Define the system’s variables.
- Define each variable’s range and fuzzy sets.
- Define the input variables’ crisp values.
- Define the rules.
- Get the predicted output.

## Getting Started
The Fuzzy Logic Toolbox is a graphical user interface (GUI) based application that allows you to easily define fuzzy logic systems.

## Examples
Here are some screenshots to help you get started with the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox:

1. Define a new fuzzy logic system:

2. Define the system's attributes

3. Define the system's variables:
   ![variable](images\Input.png)

4. Define the variable's sets:
   ![variable](images\Set.png)
 
5. Define the input variables' crisp values:
   ![crisp](images\Crisp.png)

6. Define the rules:
   ![rule](images\Rule.png)

7. Get the predicted output:

## Validation
The Fuzzy Logic Toolbox will not run unless everything has been inputted correctly. In case of incorrect inputs, an error message will be displayed.
